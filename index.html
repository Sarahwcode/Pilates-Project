            <h3>Why Pilates?</h3>
            <h2>Expereince peace with move with Nicole</h2>
            <p>
              Pilates is named after Joseph Pilates. Joseph Pilates had a very
              explicit Pilates program (actually several, programs for the mat,
              for machines like the reformer, etc). Pilates' programs are now
              referred to as "classical" Pilates. Following Pilates, there are
              several lineages of trainers who continued Pilates heritage. Also
              with Pilates becoming more popular, there are tons of adaptions of
              pilates.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think a common thing of all things Pilates is a certain focus on
              stabilizing and working "the core" of the body. Compared to
              "classical Pilates" many modern approaches feature a more
              accessible way to achieve the necessary core strength for the
              classical Pilates exercises. If you would do Joseph Pilates mat
              workout as an untrained Person, you'd probably just fail because
              you lack the strength to achieve the positions in that program.
